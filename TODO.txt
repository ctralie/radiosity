*Add the relevant radiosity fields to EMScene

*Understand rendering equation and hemicube warping

*Implement mesh edge splitting rules for adaptive subdivision

*Set up radiosity variable (3 doubles for RGB) that resides in each face, and set up a function to draw those variables

*Calculate form factors using hemicubes
